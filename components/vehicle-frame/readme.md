# Agrofelis chassis frame design and fabrication

# Abstract 

The current document focuses on the manufacturing details of the vehicle's frame. The frame houses and protects the 8kw power module with its LiFePO4 batteries, the electronics, the sensors and actuators of the unmanned vehicle. 
The frame implemented using regular square iron bars of 20 mm width, establishes key placeholders for mounting the detachable wheels, the protective covers and via its grid-like attachment points enables to mount anticipated tools, as well as future ones. The primary design considerations were footprint minimization, battery compartment protection, chassis rigidity, and ease of manufacture utilizing low-budget tools and readily available materials.

The documentation presents the frame fabrication by decomposing it into its individual elements and fabrication steps.

# Introduction

The cross like symmetric chassis frame of the vehicle can be decomposed into identical bottom and top parts, a middle part contributing to the chassis height, front and back wheel mounting points, a fixed protective cover for the batteries, and a grid-like array of mounting sockets. 

The following figure illustrates the schematics of the chassis from multiple view points.

6. The front wheel mounting points part

## Stepwise frame fabrication

This section delves into the systematic fabrication of the chassis, which unfolds across seven distinct steps. In addition, for each step, we provide accompanying images to aid comprehension and ease of reference.

### Step 01

The first part of the chassis fabrication is the bottom part, which is clearly illustrated by the following projection diagram.

### Step 02

In the second step, in the bottom part of the frame, a 3 mm thick iron sheet following the battery compartment silhouette is welded, securing the 8kw LiFePO4 batteries from external forces, as illustrated by the following diagram.

### Step 03

In the third step of the fabrication, the top part is being implemented. This part, in conjunction with the already constructed bottom part, is showcased in the diagram below.

The bottom and top part of the frame as fabricated are snapshot-ed, by the following images.

### Step 04

In the fourth step of the fabrication, the middle bars are MIG welded, connecting the top and bottom parts implemented in the previous steps, as shown in the image below.

The following images showcase the fabricated top, bottom and middle parts of the chassis.

### Step 05

Proceeding to the fifth step of the fabrication, the back wheel attachment points are being fabricated, as depicted in the succeeding illustration. The back wheel attachment points, enable to dismantle the related modules or to interchange the steering wheels according the the scope of the problem.

Further insight into the manufactured part can be seen in the following image.

> Although not crucial, these vertical bars can be offset-ed by 30 mm, something that is performed by the prototype frame using some additional drilled bars and washers, meticulously documented in the  dedicated document presenting the steering wheels module.

### Step 06

In the sixth step of the chassis fabrication, the front wheel attachments, using regular T-shaped iron bars of 25 mm width by 25 mm height, are welded onto the corner bars, allowing to interchange easily the front wheels of the robot and to support future wheel design variations based on the problem targeting.

### Step 07

Concluding with the seventh step of the chassis fabrication, a plethora of nuts are welded into the all corners formed by the iron bards. These nuts serve dual purposes, allowing to mount the protecting covers of the frame and establishing multiple mounting points for tools and extensions of the Agrofelis Robot. The arrangement of grid-like mounting socket locations in the fabricated chassis is depicted in the following image.

## Finalization steps

As with all metallic parts of the Agrofelis robot, the frame is being coated with a two-layer primer application, followed by a double coating of oil paint.
Additionally, a 5 mm compressible foam is glued to the external surfaces of the frame. This measure ensures almost air-tight protection when the covers are attached, effectively safeguarding internal components against dust and water.

## Summary

The development process, component details and essential dimensions for reproducing the Agrofelis chassis has been documented in a progressive manner. A photograph of the vehicle with some covers removed, exposing details of the end frame, is presented in the closing image below.
