# Abstract 

This document focuses on the manufacturing details of the frame of the vehicle. The frame houses and protects the 8kw power module with its lifepo4 batteries, the electronics, the sensors and actuators of the unmanned vehicle. The frame implemented using regular iron bars establishes key placeholders for mounting the detachable wheels, the protective covers and via its grid like attach points enables to mount anticipated tools, as well as future ones. Primary factors of the design were the footprint minimization, the power module protection, the rigidity of the chassis and ease of manufacturing using low budget tools and readily available materials. 
The documentation presents the frame by decomposing it into its individual elements and enhancement phases.

# Introduction

The cross like symmetric chassis frame of the vehicle, can be decomposed into its identical bottom and top part, the middle part 
contributing to the chassis height, the front and back wheel mounting points, a fixed protective cover for the batteries, and into a grid like array of mounting sockets. The following figure illustrates the completed chassis from different view points.
