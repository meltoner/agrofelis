This part of the Agrofelis Motors hub driver, deals with the structural elements of the composite module.
The structural component aims is to combine all the sub components as well guide the air flow efficiently to 
cool down the elements during their operation. The structural components are glued together and are spray painted.
The structural components create sockets to host two temperature sensors, sockets to host the two power modules vertically, sockets to attach the analog drivers, as well as holes indicating exactly where the PCB boards can be attached.

The Motors Hub structure is composed of the following components :

1. Five 4 mm ply-wood cut using a laser cutter, with their schematics located within box_wood_layers\laser_cut and box_fins\3d_print folders. The layers are glued together forming the bottom part using the 1-3 layers and the top part using the layers 4 and 5. 
2. Four 3d printed elements guiding the air flow along both sides of the analog motor drivers as well as supporting the elements.
3. Wood glue
4. A spray paint 

The schematics folder document the procedure to re-create the end CNC and 3d print instructions in their respective folders.
