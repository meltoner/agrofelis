The documentation moreover list all the utilised components, their price along with indicative suppliers easening the reproducibility of the system. 

# Introduction

The power module and its sub-elements is the most expensive module of the Agrofelis robot. A staggering 8 KW battery system was chosen in view of being able to perform an 8 hour shift while on a relatively moderate energy demanding work peaking between 500 watt and 1000 watt. The latest most widely used type of batteries employed in off the grid solar panels systems were chosen, called LifePo4. The type of technology was furthermore chosen for their unusual lifespan, high discharge rate, environmental friendliness high safety, low toxicity, their stable performance at fluctuating environmental temperatures, [^LiFePOA] their thermal and chemical stability characteristics. 

A wide range of sensors were established in the Agrofelis robot enabling to monitor the total discharge rate of the system as well as power consumption of the individual components and actuators. Employing various energy feedback sensors, enables of being able to discover and intelligently drive the different elements to their most efficient range prolonging their lifetime and the runtime of the robot. 

Passive systems usually employed in the car industry as well as active systems were installed in energy demanding routes of the system, protecting the rest of the electronics and modules in case a component fails unexpectedly. 

In the following sections the overall energy system is being decomposed to its layers, its elements and their details.

## Batteries

The battery technology chosen for the Agrofelis robot is called lithium iron phosphate battery (LiFePO 4 battery). Because of their, high safety, low toxicity, long cycle life, LFP batteries are finding a number of roles in vehicle use, utility-scale stationary applications, and backup power systems [^LiFePO]. Eight CATL 302Ah LiFePO 4 battery cells (LEP71H3L7-01) connected in series, make up the battery module of the vehicle. Each cell approximately weights 5.5 kg, can have a voltage range between 2.0V and 3.65V with a nominal voltage of 3.2v, while is able operate between -35 and 65 â„ƒ. Their life cycle exceeds 4000 charge discharge cycles corresponding to nearly 11 years, if the robot is operated on a daily basis. The battery lifespan can also be expanded if the depth of charge and discharge rates are bounded to lower levels than their maximum. The batteries nominal discharge rate is at 0.5C and the maximum continues rate is 1.0 C. This means that the system can effectively deliver constantly 150 amps and peak safely up to 300 amps of power.

The following perhaps peculiar battery arrangment, enables to minimise the overall footprint of the vehicle by aproximately 20 cm.

In order to isolate the batteries from external temperature differnces pieaces as well as compensate for minor acumuliative dimensions differences either in the batteries or in the frame, as well facilitate as shock abosorbers, pieces of plywood wood are cut and inserted in between the frame and the bateries.
The pieces of wood allow to gently impose compressing forces into the batteries preventing them from expanding during their charchring and discharcging cycles prolonging ther lifetime.
