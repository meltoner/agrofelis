tplinkWR802N_conf configures as wireless router instead
the benefit is that the wifi network is stable when no wifi access point is availables
the sideeffect is that we can't have internet connectivity via an access point and jetson needs to connect via a wifi card instead of ethernet with tplink.

Since mobile on the go is not gurranteed at all times the wireless router is used instead for stability.
